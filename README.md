## Project Explanation
### 21 Game
The project we are proposing is called 21 game in which there are 2 players playing in turns. The goal of this game is to reach 21 points. If both players reach a score of more than 21, then to determine the winner based on the smallest difference with 21. Both players are free to add their points, but if they have reached or more than a score of 21, they cannot add more points.
